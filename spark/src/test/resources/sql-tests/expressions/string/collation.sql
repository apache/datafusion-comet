-- collation(expr) returns the collation name of a string expression.
-- It folds to a string literal at planning time, so Comet evaluates it natively.

-- default collation on a string literal
query
SELECT collation('abc')

-- collation of an explicit UTF8_BINARY string
query
SELECT collation('hello' COLLATE UTF8_BINARY)

-- collation of a NULL string
query
SELECT collation(CAST(NULL AS STRING))
