# Comet Benchmarking Scripts

This directory contains scripts used for generating benchmark results that are published in this repository and in 
the Comet documentation.

## Example usage

Set Spark environment variables:

```shell
export SPARK_HOME=/opt/spark-3.5.3-bin-hadoop3/
export SPARK_MASTER=spark://yourhostname:7077
```

Set path to queries and data:

```shell
export TPCH_QUERIES=/mnt/bigdata/tpch/queries/
export TPCH_DATA=/mnt/bigdata/tpch/sf100/
```

Run Spark benchmark:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
sudo ./drop-caches.sh
./spark-tpch.sh
```

Run Comet benchmark:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
export COMET_JAR=/opt/comet/comet-spark-spark3.5_2.12-0.9.0.jar
sudo ./drop-caches.sh
./comet-tpch.sh
```

Run Gluten benchmark:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
export GLUTEN_JAR=/opt/gluten/gluten-velox-bundle-spark3.5_2.12-linux_amd64-1.4.0.jar
sudo ./drop-caches.sh
./gluten-tpch.sh
```

Generating charts:

```shell
python3 generate-comparison.py --benchmark tpch --labels "Spark 3.5.3" "Comet 0.9.0" "Gluten 1.4.0" --title "TPC-H @ 100 GB (single executor, 8 cores, local Parquet files)" spark-tpch-1752338506381.json comet-tpch-1752337818039.json gluten-tpch-1752337474344.json
```
