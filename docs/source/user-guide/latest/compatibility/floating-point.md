# Floating-point Number Comparison

Spark normalizes NaN and zero for floating point numbers for several cases. See `NormalizeFloatingNumbers` optimization rule in Spark.
However, one exception is comparison. Spark does not normalize NaN and zero when comparing values
because they are handled well in Spark (e.g., `SQLOrderingUtil.compareFloats`). But the comparison
functions of arrow-rs used by DataFusion do not normalize NaN and zero (e.g., [arrow::compute::kernels::cmp::eq](https://docs.rs/arrow/latest/arrow/compute/kernels/cmp/fn.eq.html#)).
So Comet adds additional normalization expression of NaN and zero for comparisons, and may still have differences
to Spark in some cases, especially when the data contains both positive and negative zero. This is likely an edge
case that is not of concern for many users. If it is a concern, setting `spark.comet.exec.strictFloatingPoint=true`
will make relevant operations fall back to Spark.

`array_min` and `array_max` use Spark-compatible native comparisons in both strict and non-strict
floating-point modes. Signed zeros compare equal, and all NaN representations compare equal and
greater than non-NaN values. The original first equal element is retained: for example,
`array_min(array(0.0D, -0.0D))` returns `0.0`, while reversing those elements returns `-0.0`.
The same ordering applies recursively to floating-point fields in arrays and structs. These
expressions do not require Spark's codegen dispatcher for floating-point compatibility.
