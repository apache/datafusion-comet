# Spark Expression Support

This page is the complete reference for how Apache Comet handles each Spark built-in
expression. Comet accelerates expressions either with a native (Rust) implementation or by
dispatching to a Spark-compatible codegen path. When an expression is not supported, Comet
transparently falls back to Spark for that part of the plan; results are unaffected.

Expressions marked ✅ Supported are enabled by default and produce Spark-compatible results.

Some ✅ Supported expressions have specific incompatible cases that are not run by default.
Those cases must be opted into per expression with
`spark.comet.expression.EXPRNAME.allowIncompatible=true` (where `EXPRNAME` is the Spark
expression class name, for example `Cast`). There is no global opt-in. By default such a case
either falls back to Spark (for example `cast`) or, when the expression has a Spark-compatible
codegen-dispatch implementation, runs through that instead (for example the regex and JSON
families). See [Native and codegen-dispatch implementations](compatibility/index.md#native-and-codegen-dispatch-implementations)
for how Comet chooses.

Most expressions can also be disabled with `spark.comet.expression.EXPRNAME.enabled=false`, where
`EXPRNAME` is the Spark expression class name (for example `Length` or `StartsWith`). See the
[Comet Configuration Guide](configs.md) for the full list.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ Supported | Comet produces Spark-compatible results by default. Some inputs or forms may fall back to Spark, and any incompatible behavior is opt-in (off by default). |
| 🔜 Planned | Intended; tracked by an open issue or pull request. |

## Not currently planned

Comet focuses acceleration on mainstream relational, string, datetime, math, and collection
expressions. The following function families are **not currently planned** for native acceleration (they are not on the 1.0 roadmap): specialized functionality with narrow real-world analytics use and high implementation cost. They fall back to Spark and may be reconsidered based on demand:

- **Probabilistic sketches and approximate top-k** (`kll_sketch_*`, `hll_*`, `theta_*`, `count_min_sketch`, `bitmap_*`, `approx_top_k*`): specialized data structures with exact-correctness traps.
- **Geospatial** (`st_*`): brand-new Spark 4.1 functionality, specialized.
- **Avro / Protobuf codecs** (`from_avro`, `to_avro`, `from_protobuf`, `to_protobuf`, `schema_of_avro`): format conversion belongs at the IO layer, not expression evaluation.
- **JVM reflection** (`java_method`, `reflect`): niche, and they invoke arbitrary JVM methods (a security concern).
- **UTF-8 validation** (`is_valid_utf8`, `make_valid_utf8`, `validate_utf8`, `try_validate_utf8`): niche Spark 4.x string-validation helpers.
- **Miscellaneous niche** (`histogram_numeric`, `version`, `sentences`, `quote`): low-value or specialized functions with little benefit from native acceleration.

The file-metadata functions `input_file_name`, `input_file_block_start`, and `input_file_block_length` depend on scan-internal per-row file information rather than the expression layer; their support status is covered in the [scan compatibility guide](compatibility/scans.md).

Note that `approx_count_distinct`, `median`, and `mode` are planned: they are mainstream (`median` and `mode` are exact aggregates). `approx_percentile` / `percentile_approx` are not currently planned because their approximate results cannot be made bit-identical to Spark.

The tables below list every Spark built-in expression with its current status.

## window_funcs

Window functions run via `CometWindowExec`. Aggregate window functions
(`count`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `avg`, `first_value`, `last_value`),
ranking functions (`row_number`, `rank`, `dense_rank`, `percent_rank`,
`cume_dist`, `ntile`), and value-shift functions (`lag`, `lead`,
`nth_value`) are all wired in the window serde and execute natively.
A handful of frame shapes still fall back — see the per-function notes
for the exact unsupported cases.

## Beyond SQL functions

Comet also accelerates a number of Catalyst expressions that have no Spark SQL function name and therefore do not appear in the tables above. These arise from the DataFrame API, from SQL syntax other than function calls, or from the query optimizer. They include:

- **Operator and optimizer-injected expressions:** runtime bloom-filter join probes (`BloomFilterMightContain`, `BloomFilterAggregate`), optimized `IN` sets (`InSet`), scalar subqueries (`ScalarSubquery`), and floating-point normalization (`KnownFloatingPointNormalized`).
- **Accessor expressions (subscript and field access, not functions):** struct field access (`col.field`), array element access (`arr[i]`), and map value access (`map[key]`).
- **Internal decimal arithmetic:** `CheckOverflow`, `MakeDecimal`, and `UnscaledValue`, which the analyzer inserts around decimal operations.
- **User-defined functions:** Scala UDFs registered through the DataFrame or SQL API.
- **Structural expressions:** aliases, attribute references, literals, sort orders, and `CASE WHEN`.

This list is illustrative, not exhaustive: the per-function tables are not the complete set of expressions Comet can accelerate.
