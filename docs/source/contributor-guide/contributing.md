# Contributing to Apache DataFusion Comet

We welcome contributions to Comet in many areas, and encourage new contributors to get involved.

Here are some areas where you can help:

- Testing Comet with existing Spark jobs and reporting issues for any bugs or performance issues
- Contributing code to support Spark expressions, operators, and data types that are not currently supported
- Reviewing pull requests and helping to test new features for correctness and performance
- Improving documentation

## Finding issues to work on

We maintain a list of good first issues in GitHub [here](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). We also have a [roadmap](roadmap.md).

## Reporting issues

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/issues) for bug reports and feature requests.

## Asking for Help

The Comet project uses the same Slack and Discord channels as the main Apache DataFusion project. See details at
[Apache DataFusion Communications]. There are dedicated Comet channels in both Slack and Discord.

## Regular public meetings

The Comet contributors hold regular video calls where new and current contributors are welcome to ask questions and
coordinate on issues that they are working on.

See the [Apache DataFusion Comet community meeting] Google document for more information.
