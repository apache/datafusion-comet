# Comet Benchmarking Guide

To track progress on performance, we regularly run benchmarks derived from TPC-H and TPC-DS. Data generation and 
benchmarking documentation and scripts are available in the [DataFusion Benchmarks](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-benchmarks) GitHub repository.

We also have many micro benchmarks that can be run from an IDE located [here](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/tree/main/spark/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/benchmark).
