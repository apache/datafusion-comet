# Apache DataFusion Comet: Benchmarks Derived From TPC-DS

The following benchmarks were performed on a Linux workstation with PCIe 5, AMD 7950X CPU (16 cores), 128 GB RAM, and
data stored locally in Parquet format on NVMe storage. Performance characteristics will vary in different environments 
and we encourage you to run these benchmarks in your own environments.

The tracking issue for improving TPC-DS performance is [#858](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/issues/858).

The raw results of these benchmarks in JSON format is available here:

- [Spark](0.3.0/spark-tpcds.json)
- [Comet](0.3.0/comet-tpcds.json)
