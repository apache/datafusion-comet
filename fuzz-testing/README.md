# Comet Fuzz

Comet Fuzz is a standalone project for generating random data and queries and executing queries against Spark 
with Comet disabled and enabled and checking for incompatibilities.

Although it is a simple tool it has already been useful in finding many bugs.

Comet Fuzz is inspired by the [SparkFuzz](https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/30222) paper from Databricks and CWI.

## Roadmap

Planned areas of improvement:

- ANSI mode
- Support for all data types, expressions, and operators supported by Comet
- IF and CASE WHEN expressions
- Complex (nested) expressions
- Literal scalar values in queries
- Add option to avoid grouping and sorting on floating-point columns
- Improve join query support:
  - Support joins without join keys
  - Support composite join keys
  - Support multiple join keys
  - Support join conditions that use expressions

## Usage

Build the jar file first.

```shell
mvn package
```

Set appropriate values for `SPARK_HOME`, `SPARK_MASTER`, and `COMET_JAR` environment variables and then use
`spark-submit` to run CometFuzz against a Spark cluster.

### Generating Data Files

```shell
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \
    --master $SPARK_MASTER \
    --class org.apache.comet.fuzz.Main \
    target/comet-fuzz-spark3.4_2.12-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
    data --num-files=2 --num-rows=200 --num-columns=100
```

### Generating Queries

Generate random queries that are based on the available test files.

```shell
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \
    --master $SPARK_MASTER \
    --class org.apache.comet.fuzz.Main \
    target/comet-fuzz-spark3.4_2.12-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
    queries --num-files=2 --num-queries=500
```

Note that the output filename is currently hard-coded as `queries.sql`

### Execute Queries

```shell
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \
    --master $SPARK_MASTER \
    --conf spark.sql.extensions=org.apache.comet.CometSparkSessionExtensions \
    --conf spark.comet.enabled=true \
    --conf spark.comet.exec.enabled=true \
    --conf spark.comet.exec.all.enabled=true \
    --conf spark.shuffle.manager=org.apache.spark.sql.comet.execution.shuffle.CometShuffleManager \
    --conf spark.comet.exec.shuffle.enabled=true \
    --conf spark.comet.exec.shuffle.mode=auto \
    --jars $COMET_JAR \
    --conf spark.driver.extraClassPath=$COMET_JAR \
    --conf spark.executor.extraClassPath=$COMET_JAR \
    --class org.apache.comet.fuzz.Main \
    target/comet-fuzz-spark3.4_2.12-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
    run --num-files=2 --filename=queries.sql
```

Note that the output filename is currently hard-coded as `results-${System.currentTimeMillis()}.md`
