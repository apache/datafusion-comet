# datafusion-comet-spark-expr: Spark-compatible Expressions

This crate provides Apache Spark-compatible expressions for use with DataFusion and is maintained as part of the 
[Apache DataFusion Comet] subproject.

# Deprecation Notice

The expressions in this crate are being migrated to the [datafusion-spark] crate, which is part of the core DataFusion
project.

The DataFusion Comet project will stop publishing new versions of the `datafusion-comet-spark-expr` crate in the future.

There is a GitHub issue (https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/issues/2084) to track the work of migrating
functionality from this crate to `datafusion-spark`.
