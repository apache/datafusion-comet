//! Define JNI APIs which can be called from Java/Scala.
//!
//! An entry point is a thin JNI wrapper: it converts its JNI arguments into plain Rust values,
//! calls a core function whose signature has no JNI types (e.g. `decode_shuffle_block`), and
//! converts the result back. Errors and panics are raised as JVM exceptions by
//! `try_unwrap_or_throw`, through the boundary error protocol in `errors::NativeError`.
//!
//! `createPlan`, `setShufflePartitionPusher`, `executePlan` and `releasePlan` also depend on
//! upcalls into the JVM (input iterators, the task memory manager, metrics, UDFs and scalar
//! subqueries), so their core logic keeps holding JNI references.
