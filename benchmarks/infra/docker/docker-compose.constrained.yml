# Constrained memory overlay.
#
# Apply on top of docker-compose.yml to enforce hard memory limits and
# enable the metrics-collector sidecar:
#
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.constrained.yml up -d
#
# Environment variables:
#   WORKER_MEM_LIMIT   - Hard memory limit for the worker (default: 6g)
#   BENCH_MEM_LIMIT    - Hard memory limit for the bench runner (default: 10g)
#   METRICS_INTERVAL   - Collection interval in seconds (default: 1)

services:
  spark-worker:
    mem_limit: ${WORKER_MEM_LIMIT:-6g}
    memswap_limit: ${WORKER_MEM_LIMIT:-6g}   # same as mem_limit → no swap
