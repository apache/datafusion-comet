# Tracing

Tracing can be enabled by setting `spark.comet.tracing.enabled=true`. Additionally, enabling the `jemalloc` 
feature will enable tracing of native memory allocations.

```shell
make release COMET_FEATURES="jemalloc"
```

With this feature enabled, each Spark executor will write a JSON event log file in 
Chrome's [Trace Event Format].

Example output:

```json
