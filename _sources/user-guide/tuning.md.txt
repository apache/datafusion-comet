# Tuning Guide

Comet provides some tuning options to help you get the best performance from your queries.

## Memory Tuning

Comet shares an off-heap memory pool between Spark and Comet. This requires setting `spark.memory.offHeap.enabled=true`.
If this setting is not enabled, Comet will not accelerate queries and will fall back to Spark.

Each executor will have a single memory pool which will be shared by all native plans being executed within that
process, and by Spark itself. The size of the pool is specified by `spark.memory.offHeap.size`.

### Determining How Much Memory to Allocate

Generally, increasing memory overhead will improve query performance, especially for queries containing joins and
aggregates.

Once a memory pool is exhausted, the native plan will start spilling to disk, which will slow down the query.

Insufficient memory allocation can also lead to out-of-memory (OOM) errors.

## Configuring spark.executor.memoryOverhead

In some environments, such as Kubernetes and YARN, it is important to correctly set `spark.executor.memoryOverhead` so
that it is possible to allocate off-heap memory.

Comet will automatically set `spark.executor.memoryOverhead` based on the `spark.comet.memory*` settings so that
resource managers respect Apache Spark memory configuration before starting the containers.

Note that there is currently a known issue where this will be inaccurate when using Native Memory Management because it
does not take executor concurrency into account. The tracking issue for this is
https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/issues/949.

## Optimizing Joins

Spark often chooses `SortMergeJoin` over `ShuffledHashJoin` for stability reasons. If the build-side of a
`ShuffledHashJoin` is very large then it could lead to OOM in Spark.

Vectorized query engines tend to perform better with `ShuffledHashJoin`, so for best performance it is often preferable
to configure Comet to convert `SortMergeJoin` to `ShuffledHashJoin`. Comet does not yet provide spill-to-disk for
`ShuffledHashJoin` so this could result in OOM. Also, `SortMergeJoin` may still be faster in some cases. It is best
to test with both for your specific workloads.

To configure Comet to convert `SortMergeJoin` to `ShuffledHashJoin`, set `spark.comet.exec.replaceSortMergeJoin=true`.

## Shuffle

Comet provides accelerated shuffle implementations that can be used to improve the performance of your queries.

To enable Comet shuffle, set the following configuration in your Spark configuration:

```
spark.shuffle.manager=org.apache.spark.sql.comet.execution.shuffle.CometShuffleManager
spark.comet.exec.shuffle.enabled=true
```

`spark.shuffle.manager` is a Spark static configuration which cannot be changed at runtime.
It must be set before the Spark context is created. You can enable or disable Comet shuffle
at runtime by setting `spark.comet.exec.shuffle.enabled` to `true` or `false`.
Once it is disabled, Comet will fall back to the default Spark shuffle manager.

### Shuffle Mode

Comet provides three shuffle modes: Columnar Shuffle, Native Shuffle and Auto Mode.

#### Auto Mode

`spark.comet.exec.shuffle.mode` to `auto` will let Comet choose the best shuffle mode based on the query plan. This
is the default.

#### Columnar (JVM) Shuffle

Comet Columnar shuffle is JVM-based and supports `HashPartitioning`, `RoundRobinPartitioning`, `RangePartitioning`, and
`SinglePartitioning`. This mode has the highest query coverage.

Columnar shuffle can be enabled by setting `spark.comet.exec.shuffle.mode` to `jvm`. If this mode is explicitly set,
then any shuffle operations that cannot be supported in this mode will fall back to Spark.

#### Native Shuffle

Comet also provides a fully native shuffle implementation, which generally provides the best performance. However,
native shuffle currently only supports `HashPartitioning` and `SinglePartitioning`.

To enable native shuffle, set `spark.comet.exec.shuffle.mode` to `native`. If this mode is explicitly set,
then any shuffle operations that cannot be supported in this mode will fall back to Spark.

## Metrics

Some Comet metrics are not directly comparable to Spark metrics in some cases:

- `CometScanExec` uses nanoseconds for total scan time. Spark also measures scan time in nanoseconds but converts to
  milliseconds _per batch_ which can result in a large loss of precision, making it difficult to compare scan times
  between Spark and Comet.

Comet also adds some custom metrics:

### ShuffleWriterExec

| Metric           | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jvm_fetch_time` | Measure the time it takes for `ShuffleWriterExec` to fetch batches from the JVM. Note that this does not include the execution time of the query that produced the input batches. |
