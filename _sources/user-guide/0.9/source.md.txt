# Building Comet From Source

It is sometimes preferable to build from source for a specific platform.

## Using a Published Source Release

Official source releases can be downloaded from https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/datafusion/

```console
# Pick the latest version
export COMET_VERSION=0.9.1
# Download the tarball
curl -O "https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/datafusion/datafusion-comet-0.9.1/apache-datafusion-comet-0.9.1.tar.gz"
# Unpack
tar -xzf apache-datafusion-comet-0.9.1.tar.gz
cd apache-datafusion-comet-0.9.1
```

Build

```console
make release-nogit PROFILES="-Pspark-3.5"
```

## Building from the GitHub repository

Clone the repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet.git
```

Build Comet for a specific Spark version:

```console
cd datafusion-comet
make release PROFILES="-Pspark-3.5"
```

Note that the project builds for Scala 2.12 by default but can be built for Scala 2.13 using an additional profile:

```console
make release PROFILES="-Pspark-3.5 -Pscala-2.13"
```

To build Comet from the source distribution on an isolated environment without an access to `github.com` it is necessary to disable `git-commit-id-maven-plugin`, otherwise you will face errors that there is no access to the git during the build process. In that case you may use:

```console
make release-nogit PROFILES="-Pspark-3.5"
```
